# BANKING-Credit-Risk-Analytics
The application of scoring models in today ’s business environment covers a wide range of objectives. The original task of estimating the risk of default hasbeen augmented by credit scoring models to include other aspects of credit risk management: at the pre-application stage (identification of potential applicants), at the application stage (identification of acceptable applicants),and at the performance stage (identification of possible behavior of current customers). Scoring models with different objectives have been developed.
They can be generalized into four categories as listed below. 

1. MARKETING ASPECT:
Purposes:
Identify credit-worthy customers most likely to respond to promotional activity
in order to reduce the cost of customer acquisition and minimize customer
dissatisfaction.
Predict the likelihood of losing valuable customers and enable organizations to
formulate effective customer retention strategy.
2. APPLICATION ASPECT
Purposes
Decide whether to extend credit, and how much credit to extend. 
Forecast the future behavior of a new credit applicant by predicting loandefault chances or poor repayment behaviors at the time the credit is granted.

3. PERFORMANCE ASPECT
Purpose:
Predict the future payment behavior of existing debtors in order to
identify/isolate bad customers to direct more attention and assistance to
them, thereby reducing the likelihood that these debtors will later become a
problem.

4. BAD DEBT MANAGEMENT
Purpose:
Select optimal collections policies in order to minimize the cost of administering collections or maximizing the amount recovered from a delinquent’s account.
